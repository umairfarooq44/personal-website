I worked on ePharma which is B2B ecommerce web app for pharmacists so that they can sell and manage their products.

I have worked and developed from the start on oil and gas managing web app DNow for one year. DNow helps manage valves and surveys of oil and gas rigs. I was also given the opportunity to technically lead the project and play my role as a developer as well.

I have worked on Droobi, health care web app. Droobi helped patients interact with doctors and dieticians.

I have worked on Pakistan Telehealth which is used by the government of pakistan to fight against COVID-19. The doctors sign up and after verification they can consult with patients.
