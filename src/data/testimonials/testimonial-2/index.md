I had the pleasure of working with Umair for a few months. As I had just joined the team, he immediately supported me with any information I needed. He was able to quickly and efficiently deal with any implementation challenge we faced, even when working with new technology. Moreover, he was always open to provide valuable input to help improve our team's way of working. I would recommend Umair as a highly dedicated developer and a great team player.
