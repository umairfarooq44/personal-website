I had the pleasure of having Umair on my team during our time at Morressier. He demonstrated deep knowledge of modern React patterns and best practices, delivering clean and readable code, well-abstracted and on time.
He actively participated in shaping our work for the better, initiating and participating in open and constructive collaboration with colleagues from engineering, product, and design.
His professionalism, attitude, and personality made him a well-liked team member, and I believe he will be a great asset to any team.
